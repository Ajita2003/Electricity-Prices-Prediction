# Electricity Prices Prediction 

This is a Data Science Project for predicting and evaluating electricity prices based on various features. It includes data visualization features such as correlation heatmap and month vs SMPEP2 plot.

## Features

- Predict electricity prices using a machine learning model.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualize data with a correlation heatmap and month vs SMPEP2 plot.
- About the developer section with links and information.
